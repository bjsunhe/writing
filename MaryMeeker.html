"We would look up stuff and read. We would go through Standard & Poor's or a Moody's Manual and look at companies selling below working capital. There were a lot then," recalls Schloss.




I read the first edition of this book early in 1950, when I was nineteen. I thought then that it was by far the best book about investing ever written. I still think it is.

To invest successfully over a lifetime does not require a stratospheric IQ, unusual business insights, or inside information. What's needed is a sound intellectual framework for making decisions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that framework. This book precisely and clearly prescribes the proper framework. You must supply the emotional discipline.

If you follow the behavioral and business principles that Graham advocates - and if you pay special attention to the invaluable advice in Chapters 8 and 20 - you will not get a poor result from your investments. (That represents more of an accomplishment than you might think.) Whether you achieve outstanding results will depend on the effort and intellect you apply to your investments, as well as on the amplitudes of stock-market folly that prevail during your investing career. The sillier the market's behavior, the greater the opportunity for the business-like investor. Follow Graham and you will profit from folly rather than participate in it.

To me, Ben Graham was far more than an author or a teacher. More than any other man except my father, he influenced my life. Shortly after Ben's death in 1976, I wrote the following short remembrance about him in the Financial Analysts Journal. As you read the book, I believe you'll perceive some of the qualities I mentioned in this tribute.


Benjamin Graham
1894-1976
Several years ago Ben Graham, then almost eighty, expressed to a friend the thought that he hoped every day to do "something foolish, something creative and something generous."
The inclusion of that first whimsical goal reflected his knack for packaging ideas in a form that avoided any overtones of sermonizing or self-importance. Although his ideas were powerful, their delivery was unfailingly gentle.

Readers of this magazine need no elaboration of his achievements as measuered by the standard of creativity. It is rare that the founder of a discipline does not find his work eclipsed in rather short order by successors. But over forty years after publication of the book that brought structure and logic to a disorderly and confused activity, it is difficult to think of possible candidates for even the runner-up position in the field of security analysis. In an area where much looks foolish within weeks or months after publication, Ben's principles have remained sound - their value often enhanced and better understood in the wake of financial storms that demolished flimsier intellectual structures. His counsel of soundness brought unfailing rewards to his follower - even to those with natural abilities inferior to more gifted practitioners who stumbled while following counsels of brilliance or fashion.


The Economics of Property/Casualty Insurance
Our main business - though we have others of great importance - is insurance. To understand Berkshire, therefore, it is necessary that you understand how to evaluate an insurance company. The key determinants are: 1.the amount of float that the business generates; 2.its cost; and 3.most critical of all, the long-term outlook for both of these factors.

To begin with, float is money we hold but don't own. In an insurance operation, float arises because premiums are received before losses are paid, an interval that sometimes extends over many years. During that time, the insurer invests the money. This pleasant activity typically carries with it a downside: The premiums that an insurer takes in usually do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay. That leaves it running an "underwriting loss," which is the cost of float. An insurance business has value if its cost of float over time is less than the cost the company would otherwise incur to obtain funds. But the business is a lemon if its cost of float is higher than market rates for money.

A caution is appropriate here: Because loss costs must be estimated, insurers have enormous latitude in figuring their underwriting results, and that makes it very difficult for investors to calculate a company's true cost of float. Errors of estimation, usually innocent but sometimes not, can be huge. The consequences of these miscalculations flow directly into earnings. An experienced observer can usually detect large-scale errors in reserving, but the general public can typically do no more than accept what's presented, and at times I have been amazed by the numbers that big-name auditors have implicitly blessed. In 1999 a number of insurers announced reserve adjustments that made a mockery of the "earnings" that investors had relied on earlier when making their buy and sell decisions. At Berkshire, we strive to be conservative and consistent in our reserving. Even so, we warn you that an unpleasant surprise is always possible.

The table that follows shows (at intervals) the float generated by the various segments of Berkshire's insurance operations since we entered the business 33 years ago upon acquiring National Indemnity Company (whose traditional lines are included in the segment "Other Primary"). For the table we have calculated our float - which we generate in large amounts relative to our premium volume - by adding net loss reserves, loss adjustment reserves, funds held under reinsurance assumed and unearned premium reserves, and then subtracting agents balances, prepaid acquisition costs, prepaid taxes and deferred charges applicable to assumed reinsurance.

Growth of float is important - but its cost is what's vital. Over the years we have usually recorded only a small underwriting loss - which means our cost of float was correspondingly low - or actually had an underwriting profit, which means we were being paid for holding other people's money. Indeed, our cumulative result through 1998 was an underwriting profit. In 1999, however, we incurred a $1.4 billion underwriting loss that left us with float cost of 5.8%. One mildly mitigating factor: We enthusiastically welcomed $400 million of the loss because it stems from business that will deliver us exceptional float over the next decade. The balance of the loss, however, was decidedly unwelcome, and our overall result must be judged extremely poor. Absent a mega-catastrophe, we expect float cost to fall in 2000, but any decline will be tempered by our aggressive plans for GEICO, which we will discuss later.

There are a number of people who deserve credit for manufacturing so much "no-cost" float over the years. Foremost is  Ajit Jain. It's simply impossible to overstate Ajit's value to Berkshire: He has from scratch built an outstanding reinsurance business, which during his tenure has earned an underwriting profit and now holds $6.3 billion of float.

In Ajit, we have an underwriter equipped with the intelligence to properly rate most risks; the realism to forget about those he can't evaluate; the courage to write huge policies when the premium is appropriate; and the discipline to reject even the smallest risk when the premium is inadequate. It is rare to find a person possessing any one of these talents. For one person to have them all is remarkable.

Since Ajit specializes in super-cat reinsurance, a line in which losses are infrequent but extremely large when they occur, his business is sure to be far more volatile than most insurance operations. To date, we have benefitted from good luck on this volatile book. Even so, Ajit's achievements are truly extraordinary.

In a smaller but nevertheless important way, our "other primary" insurance operation has also added to Berkshire's intrinsic value. This collection of insurers has delivered a $192 million underwriting profit over the past five years while supplying us with the float shown in the table. In the insurance world, results like this are uncommon, and for their feat we thank Rod Eldred, Brad Kinstler, John Kizer, Don Towle and Don Wurster.

As I mentioned earlier, the General Re operation had an exceptionally poor underwriting year in 1999 (though investment income left the company well in the black). Our business was extremely underpriced, both domestically and internationally, a condition that is improving but not yet corrected. Over time, however, the company should develop a growing amount of low-cost float. At both General Re and its Cologne subsidiary, incentive compensation plans are now directly tied to the variables of float growth and cost of float, the same variables that determine value for owners.

Even though a reinsurer may have a tightly focused and rational compensation system, it cannot count on every year coming up roses. Reinsurance is a highly volatile business, and neither General Re nor Ajit's operation is immune to bad pricing behavior in the industry. But General Re has the distribution, the underwriting skills, the culture, and - with Berkshire's backing - the financial clout to become the world's most profitable reinsurance company.

When Star CEOs and Star Analysts Disagree, the Market Trusts the Analysts
What matters more for investors determining what a company is worth: the company's reputation or the CEO's? What about the reputation of the stock analyst who is covering the firm?

On January 11, 2008, a day when the broader markets were only down three-quarters of 1%, American Express, led by legendary CEO Ken Chenault, dropped 10% when Oppenheimer analyst Meredith Whitney lowered her rating of the firm. That same day, Dreamworks dropped 3% when Jessica Reif-Cohen, an analyst at Merrill, lowered her rating of the company, led by entertainment mogul Jeffery Katzenberg.

Companies spend millions of dollars to build a strong reputation because they believe that it is directly related to their overall market value. But a company's reputation is not the only one that people consider when making decisions sunch as whether to invest or not; there is also the CEO's reputation and the analyst's. We wanted to understand the ways in which each of these affect firms, and how the market behaved when confronted with multiple trusted sources of information.

To explore which type of reputation has a greater impact, we drew on large databases of corporate, financial, and market information compiled over a 13-year period. We studied the effect of analyst, CEO, and firm reputation on the size of the market reactions to analyst upgrades and downgrades - in other words, whether the stock price went up or down after an analyst issued a recommendation about whether to buy, hold, or sell a firm's stock.

We measured CEO reputation by using the number of leadership awards bestowed on a chief in the five years previous to a given year by seven leading business magazines. We measured analyst reputation the standard way - by seeing which analysts were selected to one of the all-American teams published annually by Institutional Investor magazine. And we scored firm reputation by using lists of the most admired firms. In all, we studied about 19,500 downgrades and 17,400 upgrades from 1996 to 2008. Our results were recently published in the Academy of Management Journal.

With a massive literature devoted to leadership and American companies reportedly spending $14 billion a year to teach it, one might expect that a CEO's reputation would outshine those of even well-regarded analysts. Our study found otherwise.

We found that a downgrade by a star analyst causes tremendous stock valuation changes that are not offset by the CEO having a good reputation. In other words, star analysts' reputations overwhelmed those of the CEOs they were covering in terms of shareholder reaction - even when star analysts downgraded firms run by star CEOs. Specifically, we found that a downgrade by star analysts increased the negative market reaction by 40%, regardless of a CEO's reputation. Thus, when a star analyst issues a downgrade, the CEO's reputation has almost no effect on the market reaction.

In marked contrast, CEO reputation does buffer the stock market reaction to downgrades by regular analysts. The impact of a downgrade by non-star analysts was reduced by 3% when the CEO had a strong reputation. So CEO reputation influenced the market reaction to downgrades only when the analyst making the downgrade was not recognized as a star.

We found a similar pattern for upgrades. Once again, star analysts rating a firm highly had the greatest impact on the market: their ratings increased the positive market reaction by 42%.

What does this all mean? Our findings suggest that while reputation clearly matters, all reputations are not considered equally. When different reputations collide, some are going to matter more than others. Investors tended to weigh analysts' expertise more heavily than others' when making decisions. We believe this is because investors who are buying and selling stock view an analyst's reputation as most relevant to the immediate decision. CEO and firm reputation are based on factors that are less directly relevant to the specific decision to buy or sell at any given moment. This finding was somewhat surprising, however, given how many other studies have found large positive effects for CEO and firm reputation.

This scenario of weighing multiple reputations appears in many other contexts, from education markets to consumer products. For instance, universities have broad reputations, but so do individual departments, and even individual professors. Similarly, consumers are often faced with making a purchasing decision when there are multiple reputations, such as that of the product itself and its brand, as well as the reputation of store selling the product. Consequently, it is important to understand which reputation is likely to matter most. If companies are going to focus time and resources on building and maintaining their reputations, it is important to understand when it is going to matter, and when it isn't.

Firms often wonder how effectivre their brands are, or what their reputation is actually doing, and they often focus on multiple things at once. Our study suggests that people may not be balancing multiple sources of information, but may instead rely on the one source of reputation that they feel is most relevant. When multiple reputation collide, the one that is most related to the transaction at hand, and is most relevant to the person making the decision, should matter most. If a consumer, for example, cares more about a product's reliability, then they are likely to rely more on the reputation of the product than the store's. If what they care about is after-sale service, however, then the store's reputation is likely to be more influential.

We should ask the same question as consumers and investors, not just on behalf of our companies: are we paying attention to the right sources of reputation when making decisions? And given the importance of reputation on so many outcomes, future studies should look to confirm whether the effects described above bear out in practice.

Mary Meeker's Internet trends report







Q: What is your latest idea of investing in China? And if you are going to do some investments in China, which industries will be your priorities and why?

巴菲特: China is a huge market and there are more possibilities because of its size. My partner Charles Thomas Munge looks at China a lot. We focus on not price but valuation of companies. We do close research on the companies and try to buy the whole business when we invest. During the last 50 years, the population grew rapidly in China and it was full of talent and people resources. Some interruptions will not disturb its development. China and the US will become two superpower economies in the future. We do appreciate big investment opportunities in China as this country has more chances.

Q：You are one of the richest men in the world, as well as one of the most generous. What is your view of wealth? Is it established at the very beginning at a young age, or is it developed through different phases of your life?
A：This is a good question, about money. Money can buy most things, but it cannot buy time and love. I have only one thing that can count as luxury—a private jet. Other things are the same as yours. Money has no utility beyond certain point and the usage is the same to everyone. Charity can change life of many people. My wife and I both agree that we should spend money to solve the important societal problems. For example, universities in the US have external funding, but the diseases curing in Africa may not have funding. Money can bring many interesting experiences. I enjoy this game of investing. However, more stuff does not mean happier. Money cannot buy love. When people try to control their kids through money, it may bring disasters. I believe taking care of family is very important.

 Q:Bill Gates once said you are the most optimistic person he has ever known. Do you think you are optimistic, and why? Is it born with or learned later?
  A: Optimism is a very important quality for a good investor. The result of life is getting better and stronger. Compared to Age of Jefferson (like back to 1776), people did not make a lot of progress. In less than 3 life times, significant changes and developments happened. Why? Human are not smarter, nor working harder, but we hung on with our potential. The economic system and government policies are delivering unbelievable results. Compared to old times when people died, and had fewer choices, everyone in the room live a better life. Our children, younger generations will live even better. Optimistic is realistic.

   Q：If you were president, how would you make the immigrant policy?
    A：Welcoming immigrants is a grand American tradition. The country couldn’t be here without the contributions from immigrants. In 1939, two Jewish immigrants, Albert Einstein and Leo Szillard, wrote a letter to President Roosevelt, alerting him to Germany’s undergoing research of "extremely powerful bombs of a new type" and recommending that the U.S. begin similar research. The letter saved US. Steve Jobs was son of immigrant. When people comes, the market comes. President Trump is reaching to the clear present danger. However, U.S. would be a better country 50 years from now if it keeps the great tradition.

    Q：You have picked many successful companies previously. And the market will see your purchase of the stock as signals of confidence, how does this influence on your positions?

    A：I have signed some confidential treatments with the SEC, but not for my portfolio. We still need to disclose our portfolio holdings 45 days of the end of the quarter. However, I think there should be intelligence properties behind the idea of what stock to buy and these ideas should be protected. Management like the announcements though. But it will cost us a lot of money and it is negative to our investment. I have made attempt to not disclose what I am buying. We keep in mind to minimize the effects on market from our investment decisions.

     Q: What is your view of the struggling newspaper industry?

     A：In the old time, the advertisements on newspaper were source of information and it spread everything. Nowadays, the industry is declining and the classified sections do not help anymore. They lose print circulation, and thus the advertisement revenue. The internet accelerates the change of newspaper and news need to be in time. New York Times’ and Wall Street Journal’s digital part allows them to keep some print circulation (joint cost synergy). Washington Post increased online activity a few years ago. Most newspapers have not found a feasible way of paid online subscription.


      Q：What is the most important improvement you make during the investments?

       A：I was focusing on technical analysis when I was young. The intelligent investor, the book written by Benjamin Graham, reset my whole investment thinking. It taught me how to think about stock market. From my perspective, there are two courses that should be taught in all business schools: how to think about stock market and how to value stocks. Margin of safety is always the principle of investment. The formula of investing never changes. First, how sure you are? Second, how soon it will to get you there? Third, what to do to achieve it? Investing is buying a piece of business. You could buy business with one million dollars in Omaha. What will you invest? Maybe a fast-food restaurant since people need to have food every day. Go through the ideas in your mind, look at things, and grab information. That is why investing is amazing: you only need to make decisions rather than do it by yourself. Since the market prices change every day, opportunities are always there. Mr. Market is there to serve you. You should utilize it when he goes crazy rather than let him take pressure on you.

        Q：What is the best investment, favorite investment and learned-most investment in your life?
        A：The best investment is in yourself. On my wall in the office, there is a certificate degree of Dale Carnegie Course, which I signed up for giving public talking. This is the best investment ever in my life. Also we should invest in right friends. Associating with important friends will shape your life. Right friends or a spouse can make a huge difference in your life, such as my partner Charlie Munger. When I was a student, I went to an insurance company, GEICO, in Washington DC downtown on a Saturday afternoon. And I pounded on the door and the custodian let me in. He introduced me to the only person at the office at that time and he gave me a 4 hour brief about the insurance business, which changed my life. When I want to know about coal industry, I would ask people in coal companies, which competitor’s stock you will buy and which you will short and why? That is very useful for marketing research since people love to talk about their competitors.
